      <td>As the Lasernet setup in CRM is not fulfilling requirements and not giving any advantage connected to using Lasernet for FO, more the opposite e g adding more complexity and dependency towards a supplier, we want to change to the included standard setup. Pros Flexibility  - Can create your own templates including pics using word and XML Integrated  flow that gives a much more user friendly and effective way of working (email, download, sharepoint) (much) Less to worry   about  with new releases, updates, support and maintenance as not an ISV solution or setup. Removing dependecies and making it more effortless to test and deploy.     Cons When update the standard template needs to be done for all BUs but can reuse (copy & paste) Guidelines & Training on how to for Superusers - Use XML with Word and what to configure (add developer, plug-in CRM to view field names)    Need to test Templates separated per BU How to set permission on a template (Standard templates should be restricted)</td>
